      So I have the doomed post-lunch slot when
      everyone's half asleep!

      Over the next 20 minutes we're going to examine
      a new option available to mobile app developers

      Mobile's important even if you're not particularly interested in the platform
      we've almost reached desktop and mobile parity -
      mobile accounts for 50% of users on the average website

    <div class="notes">Today, mobile developers have three main choices

first, there's native app development:
Do we have any native app developers in?

developing programs on the device in Swift, Objective-C or Java depending on whether it's iOS or Android

used to be a more diverse: are any of you bothering with Blackberry, Windows or FirefoxOS?

On the flip side we have web apps:
This is a single application served from the web which runs in a browser and works on any device
In theory.

Any web developers in?
OK, just so you know I'm totally biased - I'm firmly in the web circle.

In the middle we have hybrid app development tools such as
React Native, Cordova, PhoneGap, Appcelerator.

You generally use web technologies but compile them to multiple native platform code

Which gives all the pros and many cons of both

Anyone developing hybrid apps?
Good. Those hybrid people scare me!

		<h2>User benefits of the web</h2>

		<ul>
      <li>easy to discover</li>
      <li>linkable URLs</li>
			<li>no installation or updates</li>
      <li>secure HTTPS</li>
			<li>sandboxed execution</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="notes">Native apps will be the best option in some cases.

But I'm a web guy.
and I like the benefits it brings users

- you can find a web app via Google or any search engine

- you can link to a web app with a single URL which can also pass state and other information.

- you can bookmark it - there's nothing to install or update
it doesn't use space on the device

- if you're using HTTPS no one can intercept communication between you and the service

- finally, web apps run sand-boxed
They can't access your device files or hardware unless you grant access at the time it needs it.

Anyone using Pokemon Go?
Have a look at the permissions -
as far as I know it can record audio and video and access all your files without telling you.

Just saying that if the government wanted to spy on you it would be a near perfect solution!

		<h2>Developer benefits of the web</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>single responsive application</li>
      <li>use any server language</li>
      <li>easy to deploy and update</li>
			<li>bypass the AppStores</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="notes">Being selfish and lazy there are many benefits for developers

- we need only create a single application
- we can use media queries to adapt to devices with different screen sizes

- we can use any server language we choose
there are also options if you'd prefer not to use JavaScript on the client

- they're easy to deploy and maintain

- and we can bypass all the AppStore nonsense
our web apps can contain as much nudity and swearing as we like

Clients often think an AppStore presence is important
it probably was in the early days but today
very few people actively use or install native apps
the majority use no more than three apps on average
and they install none per month

that's partly because finding apps in an AppStore can be difficult

while some apps can become incredibly popular very quickly
the majority never reach beyond a few hundred installations

but despite all the benefits of the web,
clients started saying this 5 or 6 years ago

    <blockquote><p>"We want an app"</p></blockquote>

    <div class="notes">"We want an app"

It was a bit disheartening for developers like me

I felt we'd escaped the confines of desktop development
and were now being asked to return to a more restrictive environment

OK, so few clients knew the difference between a native or web app

      <li>it's not as snappy</li>
      <li>it doesn't work offline</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="notes">but what they did know:

user retention could be more difficult
web apps didn't have an icon on the user's home screen

native apps seemed faster than web alternatives

And the killer blow was that
web apps didn't work offline.

So we prayed to the Internet overloads
and our wishes were answered

mobile browsers became better and faster

we were given 357 clunky meta tags
to target multiple devices and icons

and we got some nice APIs to handle things like
touch, full-screen, battery status and geo-location

but for offline functionality

    <div class="notes">until they used AppCache and realised it was not good

There were loads of problems:

- there were storage space limitations

- files would always come from the cache even when you were online

- if one file needed updating you had to update them all

- if one failed to download the whole app could fall over

- and it was confusing to develop
  so few of us bothered

don't even try - it's being removed from browsers

    </ol>

    <div class="notes">
      So what are they? It's an evolution beyond running an app in a browser tab

      The reason it's called progressive:
      user experience becomes better as the capabilities of the device improve

      It's up to you how you implement them but, in general users can get a native app-like experience.
      even though it's still a web application

      Visit app first time it downloads all the files it needs to run. Next launch instantaneous.

      But when you visit a web app for the second time, the browser will prompt you to install it.
      That adds an icon to your home screen in a single click
      you don't have to go through the browser menu

      There's no hunting the AppStore, accepting permissions, installing, waiting
      then realising an app was rubbish because you've already tried it.

      When you click this icon, you see a splash screen as your app loads
      and it launches with whatever browser UI you decide is necessary

      They're fast. A cold launch little slower than native because it's starting a browser
      but a warm start can be faster than native which is astounding

      And finally, they work offline and you have full control over the caching options.

      OK, so it's not a single technology - nothing is ever that simple
      let's look at what code you need...
    </div>
  </div>


  <div id="pwa-manifest" class="step" data-x="4000" data-y="0" data-z="0" data-scale="1" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="360">
    <h2>An application manifest</h2>

    <p>/manifest.json</p>

    <pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  "name": "CurEx",
  "short_name": "CurEx",
  "icons": [{
      "src": "/images/curex-256.png",
      "sizes": "256x256",
      "type": "image/png"
  }],
  "start_url": "/index.html",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#003300",
  "theme_color": "#003300"
}</code></pre>

<p>link in your HTML &lt;head&gt;</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;link rel=&quot;manifest&quot; href=&quot;/manifest.json&quot;&gt;</code></pre>

    <div class="notes">Apologies to any non-coders but this is about to get geeky
but don't worry - there's only 50 slides or so

The first step is easy and it's an application manifest.

which is a JSON file in your application root which describes
the name, colours, icons, orientation and other display options

you can do things like hide the URL bar and go full-screen
which could be useful for games

You link to the manifest in your HTML head
</div>
  </div>


  <div id="pwa-https" class="step" data-x="4000" data-y="1000" data-z="0" data-scale="1" data-rotate-x="45" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="360">
    <h2 class="big">HTTPS</h2>

    <div class="notes">Next, you must deliver your app over HTTPS - not HTTP.

The reason for that will become evident soon
but it should be a relatively easy step depending on your web host.

There is an exception

While you're developing, you can access any localhost address
and it won't require HTTPS

There's also some start-up parameters for Chrome so you can set any URL
</div>
  </div>


  <div id="pwa-serviceworker" class="step" data-x="4000" data-y="2000" data-z="0" data-scale="1" data-rotate-x="90" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="360">

    </svg>

    <div class="notes">And the final piece of the puzzle is a service worker.

This is a programmable proxy which sounds horrendously complex
it intercepts your application's network calls and can either

- return data from the web
- or data from the local cache.

it's a standard web worker script which means it runs on a separate thread
and has no direct access to the page DOM and other objects.

It must live in your web root because
it can only cache assets in the same folder or lower.

And service workers are the reason we need HTTPS.
because they decide how network calls is handled

Imagine what could happen if a nasty person managed to inject one into your site
it would have full control and could serve whatever content they liked.
</div>
  </div>


  <div id="pwa-sw-install" class="step" data-x="5000" data-y="0" data-z="0" data-scale="1" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0">
    <h2>Service Worker: installation event</h2>

    <pre><code class="language-javascript line-numbers">self.addEventListener('install', function(e) {

  e.waitUntil(
    caches.open('mycache01').then(function(cache) {
      return cache
        .addAll([
          '/',
          '/index.html',
          '/manifest.json',
          '/css/app.css',
          '/js/app.js',
        ])
        .then(function() { self.skipWaiting(); });
    })
  );

}</code></pre>

    <div class="notes">The service worker is a single JavaScript file
The browser loads it every time you go online or it'll fall back to a cached version.

And you should note it's all JavaScript promise based
which should make asynchronous calls a little easier
(although I'm not always convinced by that)

It has three main events you can create handlers for.

The first type is an installation event
this occurs when the browser loads your app for the first time.

Here, we use the CacheStorage API to open a cache named mycache01

and we add the files we need to ensure the app works offline

this is known as your application shell and should include the static assets
CSS, JavaScript and images.

it could also have your basic HTML template or page

Note you should include all alternative URLs
so we reference a single slash and index.html on lines 7 and 8
even though they're referring to the same file
    </div>
  </div>


  <div id="pwa-sw-activate" class="step" data-x="5000" data-y="1000" data-z="0" data-scale="1" data-rotate-x="-30" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0">
    <h2>Service Worker: activation event</h2>

    <pre><code class="language-javascript line-numbers">self.addEventListener('activate', function(e) {

  e.waitUntil(
    caches.keys().then(function(keyList) {
      return Promise.all(keyList.map(function(key) {
        if (key !== 'mycache01') {
          return caches.delete(key);
        }
      }));
    })
  );

  return self.clients.claim();

});</code></pre>

    <div class="notes">Next, we have the activation event which runs whenever the application launches.

You may not need it.
but a typical option is to remove older cached files.

This fetches all the caches by name and deletes any which aren't mycache01.

So if we ever update the application
we could call the cache a different name and the app will re-fetch all static assets.
    </div>
  </div>


  <div id="pwa-sw-fetch" class="step" data-x="5000" data-y="2000" data-z="0" data-scale="1" data-rotate-x="-60" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0">
    <h2>Service Worker: fetch event</h2>

    <pre><code class="language-javascript line-numbers">self.addEventListener('fetch', function(e) {

  e.respondWith(
    caches.open('mycache01').then(function(cache) {
      return fetch(e.request).then(function(response) {
        cache.put(e.request.url, response.clone());
        return response;
      });
    })
  );

});</code></pre>

    <div class="notes">Finally, we have the fetch event
which is the trickiest to understand

This intercepts file and Ajax requests and responds accordingly.

Again, you can do what you like

Here we're using the Fetch API which is a simpler promise-based version of XMLHttpRequest
and we're just caching Ajax responses when we're online.

So our service worker
intercepts the request
gets the response
puts it in the cache
then returns it to the main application

This code is intentionally simple to show the basics
but your application can be different depending on your requirements
    </div>
  </div>


  <div id="pwa-sw-register" class="step" data-x="5000" data-y="3000" data-z="0" data-scale="1" data-rotate-x="-90" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0">
    <h2>app.js: register service worker</h2>

    <pre><code class="language-javascript line-numbers">// register service worker
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker
    .register('/service-worker.js')
    .then(function() { console.log('service worker registered'); });
}</code></pre>

    <div class="notes">The next step is to load our service worker from our application's main javascript file

We can detect the browser supports service workers and register it.
</div>
  </div>


  <div id="pwa-sw-cache" class="step" data-x="5000" data-y="4000" data-z="0" data-scale="1" data-rotate-x="-135" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0">
    <h2>app.js: use cached data</h2>

    <pre><code class="language-javascript line-numbers">var url = 'https://api.call.io/';

// is data in cache?
if ('caches' in window) {
  caches.match(url).then(function(response) {
    if (response) {
      response.json().then(updateApp);
    }
  });
}

// make new call
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.open('GET', url);</code></pre>

    <div class="notes">So our service worker just:

- cached the static assets and
- previous Ajax responses.

What we can now do is check whether a response is in the cache before we make an Ajax call
we can do that in our app which is not the best way but it keeps things simple

lines 5 to 7 pass any cached JSON results to an updateApp function which updates our page.

So our app starts instantly when we have cached data

But we can then make a real web service call to check if there's any updates
and our service worker will cache the result

So this caching policy is probably the hardest part of designing your web app
deciding what to cache, when to do it and when you use cached data can be tricky.

Enough of the theory - let's look at a demonstration.
    </div>
  </div>


  <div id="curex" class="step" data-x="6000" data-y="0" data-z="0" data-scale="1" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0">
    <h2>CurEx: Currency Exchange PWA</h2>

    <img src="images/curex.png" style="width:25%;height:auto;float:left;margin-right:2em;" alt="curex" />

    <ul>
      <li>looks app-like</li>
      <li>converts between currencies</li>
      <li>loads and caches the latest rates</li>
      <li>uses cached rates when offline</li>
      <li>github.com/craigbuckler/curex/</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="notes">So I've created a simple currency conversion tool
and you can download it from GitHub

This started life as a simple client-side JavaScript application
which uses localStorage to save state

it downloads the latest exchange rates from a web service using Ajax

I then enhanced it with a service worker to
cache the essential HTML, CSS and JavaScript files
it also caches the latest exchange rates when it gets them

So when it first loads, the cached rates are shown instantly
but it will try to get current figures when you're online
and tries again every six hours

Rates don't normally change too much from day to day so the app should remain accurate

unless something unusual happens like your country
elects an inept president
or votes to leave the EU

    <ul>
      <li>it can enhance your existing web site/app</li>
      <li>the level of enhancement is up to you</li>
      <li>Desktop PWA is supported now</li>
      <li>Use Web app install banner</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="notes">but there are several positive points

- first is that it's an enhancement to your existing system

at the very least it'll make your web experience faster and better for users
it may even improve your SEO rankings

- you don't need full scale redevelopment

- you don't need to develop a single page application or anything special

- you can just apply it to your existing site and technologies

and the level of enhancement is up to you.

Google makes numerous recommendations about using material design, fancy animations
and making an app look as though it's native

but you can ignore all that - the decision is yours
you could have an "app" which does nothing more than cache the most popular pages on your web site

Google is pushing Progressive Web Apps hard.
They announced in August they're dropping Chrome packaged apps
in favour of Progressive Web Apps

And other browser vendors are behind this too.

    <div class="notes">Except one

OK, so we don't know about Apple's intentions
but we never do.

They have made some promising noises
their 5-year plan state "we should do it"
there's no certainty they'll back Progressive Web Apps

native apps raise billions of dollars for Apple
and - bless them - they've got some hefty tax bills to pay

but does it matter?

it's an enhancement
Progressive Web Apps will run on Safari
you just won't get offline and easy installation capabilities

And I suspect Apple will have to adopt it eventually
they don't want the Android experience becoming noticeably better than iOS

But that all depends on us adopting these technologies

Many of the APIs listed here are ready and more are coming soon.

The push notifications API is the most exciting

it allows your system to send notifications to a user's device
even when your app isn't running

it does that via further service worker events

It's supported now on Chrome for Android but the standards haven't been agreed yet

you also need to sign up for a Google service which may raise a few privacy issues
and Google have form when it comes to scrapping services we rely on

    <div class="notes">Progressive Web Apps finally offer us a reasonable alternative to native apps

We'll always need native apps but
the distinction between native and the web is increasingly blurred

of course, none of this technology makes it easier for us
to build apps people actually want to use

but that's hard no matter what we do.

    <h2>Development recommendations</h2>

      <li>put service worker and manifest files in the root</li>
      <li>test in Chrome 52+</li>
      <li>use incognito mode</li>
      <li>test on real devices</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="notes">so I have a few recommendations which may help

service worker code can be confusing
Google has a worked sample application which shows how they're developed

remember to place your service worker and manifest files in your web root folder

use Chrome 52 or above for testing
which should be fine because the latest is version 53

the Application tab in developer tools allows you to inspect
the manifest and service worker then emulate going offline

Incogito mode is really handy for testing your app
nothing is cached after you unload the tab.

And you can debug on a real device over USB
using the "Inspect Devices" menu
that's how I managed to install my currency exchange app on a phone

There are service worker tools in Firefox
They're not part of the standard developer toolset and I struggled with them
but better facilities are coming soon.

      I recommend getting close to the metal and write your own service worker code
      but once you understand the basics
      there are a couple of libraries you could consider to help

      And this is JavaScript
      so 1,001 libraries will appear by the end of the year

      The Service Worker cookbook is a collection of service worker snippets
      it might be a little out of date now but it's still useful
